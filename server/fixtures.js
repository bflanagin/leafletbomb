        release: `System76 is releasing the alpha of its new operating system called Pop!_OS, based on
Ubuntu (pronounced 'Pop OS'). Pop!_OS is designed for people who use their computer to 
create; whether it’s artificial intelligence, sophisticated 3D models, computer science in 
academia, or makers working on their latest invention. The Pop user interface stays out of the
way while offering extensive customization to perfect your work flow. Built on Ubuntu, you have
access to vast repositories of open source software and development tools.
"​ While our operating system and computers are great for any user, the ideas and
features we develop for Pop!_OS will be squarely focused on the professionals and
makers that use their computers to create. The project's overarching purpose, by which
all work will be measured, is making the Linux desktop as productive as possible for the
engineering, devops, and computer science fields where Linux excels."
---Carl Richell, CEO of System76---

The Pop!_OS community is in its infancy. This is a fantastic time to engage with and help
develop the processes and practices that will govern the future development of the operating
system and its community. The team is currently opening up planning for the development
roadmap, code of conduct, discussion forums, and the processes surrounding code
contribution.
Progress made on Pop!_OS has established an inviting, modern, and minimalist look and has
improved the first-use experience including streamlining installation and user setup. Work on the
first release, scheduled for October 19th, centers on appearance, stability, and overall tightness
of the user experience followed by adding new features and greater customization ability.
" We are both responsible community leaders and community members in all that we do
at System76. We are creating software and community resources with the goal of
Pop!_OS standing out as a marquee open source project. Come join us in creating an
incredible desktop experience for creators!"
---Ryan Sipes, Community Manager of System76---
